# Muxy GameLink C# Library

## Requirements

Before you get started you will want to register your extension at (dev.muxy.io)

## Getting Started

Simply copy the GameLink folder into your project.

You will need your own JSON library and Websocket library to properly use GameLink.

## Documentation

Documentation for the GameLink C# library beyond example usages is currently non-existent, but you may refer to the [C++ documentation](dev.muxy.io/docs/api) for the time being as the two libraries are very close in usage. C# documentation is currently being worked on and will be coming soon.
